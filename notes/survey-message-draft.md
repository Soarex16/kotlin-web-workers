Hi everyone! I'm planning to work on improving experience with web workers in Kotlin JS.

So, it is very important for me to know the opinion of the community. Please, share your problems, wishes and thoughts regarding the following topics:
- coroutines in Kotlin JS
- concurrency in JavaScript (your experience with libraries, use cases etc.)

For more information about this feature you can read design notes: https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/notes/web-workers.md
